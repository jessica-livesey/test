            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            
            <h3>Shopping</h3>
            
            <p>In my spare time I love to shop, shops are always getting new things in depending on the time of year so there is always a reason to go shopping</p>
            
            <h3>Interested In Travelling</h3>
            
            <p>I am interested in travelling, I enjoy visiting different places. This summer I visited Croatia, Paris, Lazarote and Amsterdam, I like to travel as often as I can.</p>
            
            <h2>Favourite Time Of The Year</h2>
            
            <h3>Christmas Time</h3>
            
            <p>Christmas is my favourite time of the year because it brings everyone together</p>
            
            <h3>Christmas Music</h3>
            
            <p>I enjoy listening to Christmas music because it somthing everyone knows and can enjoy, bringing more of a buzz to the atmosphere</p>
            
            <h3>Countdown to Christmas</h3>
            
            <p>The countdown to Christmas is the best part of Christmas because the countdown normally involves seeing everyone and shopping, there is also the help of adverts such as the Coke and John Lewis advert to help with the coundown to Christmas. There are also TV shows such as I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here to watch during the build up to Christmas</p>
            
            <h3>Christmas Shopping</h3>
            
            <p>I enjoy Christmas shopping, getting gifts for other people. Shopping is the perfect excuse to meet up with people you haven't seen in a while and Christmas gives a good reason to go. Especially because there is more to shop for a Christmas and different places to shop for example pop up Christmas shops and Manchester Christmas Markets, there is also the Seasonal Sections in existing shops to look around, so there is plenty to see when shopping.</p>
            
            <h3>Christmas Food</h3>
            
            <p>At Christmas food is one of the most important things, its something everyone can enjoy and helps to bring people together.</p>
            <p>Below I have listed 5 of my favourite Christmas foods:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Mince Pies</li>
                <li>Christmas Pudding</li>
                <li>Christmas Cake</li>
                <li>Stolen</li>
                <li>Advent Calendars</li>
            </ol> 
            
            <h3>Seeing Friends and Family</h3>
        
            <p>At Christmas, familys and friends all gather, people who live far away arrange to meet up for the exchange of presents, adding to the reasons of why Christmas is such a special time of year</p>
